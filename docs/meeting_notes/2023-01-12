avec Pierre-Evariste Dagand

Nouvel horaire pour le 2nd semestre: jeudi 13h30

## Code review

1. It's called "evaluation contexts", not "trucs Ã  trous".

2. Make smaller commits! use cherry-pick and rebase to keep the history clean

3. discussion on `TypeAbstraction`
   The terms are NOT in De Brujin -> so we can't use that in TypeAbstraction to refer to the bound variable.
   -> what we said last time about putting a string inside of TypeAbstraction won't work

4. TODO: write typechecker for stacks in the LaTeX file

5. TODO: fix frame typechecking

6. TODO: add doc for stack + the .mli file in the branch `trucs-a-trou`

7. TODO: fix the Poly test in the branch `fix-poly`
