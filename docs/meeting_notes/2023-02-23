# Meeting notes 23rd Feb 2023

- use another arrow for our transformation (the one with zig-zags)
- define this transformation bc it's not completely beta-redex (that would normally reduce into a value) - lamda x.t b -> t[x := b] - let x = t1 in t2 -> let x = t1' in t2'

  - -> write a rule system to clarify
  - add all the rules that do smth
  - and all the congruence rules

- define what free variables are
- write scopes as the pair `(t, rho)` instead of `t{rho}`
- define what it means to be well-scoped
  `t, rho` is well-scoped if ...
  - add the maths first
  - then write the english definition

Proof:

- assume goes first
- then proof sketch
  - use {}
  - use an arrow with zigzags instead of the standard arrow because we are not doing normal beta-reduction, and it's confusing

by induction on the pair (t, s), with lexicographic order
-> either we decrease `t`, and we can push on `s`
-> or we leave `t` as is and instead we have to pop `s`

Add as hypothesis:

- s is well-typed in regards to t^rho

OR more simply: just simplify the If branches when we see them, and don't add scopes to the stack
-> much easier to prove, and we can always try to go back to prove this implementation later
